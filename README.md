<h3>Key Features & Benefits of the Viewer:</h3>

**Cross-Browser Compatibility.** Documents embedded to a web-page with GroupDocs.Viewer for Java can be viewed from any popular browser, including IE8+, Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Safari5+ and their mobile versions.

<strong>Clear Fonts Rendering.</strong> The viewer provides two document rendering modes. By default, it extracts text from documents and then renders it over the rasterized document backgrounds. There is also an HTML5-based mode which converts documents to pure HTML+CSS+SVG. Each mode ensures that fonts look sharp since documents are rendered as real text files, not images. This also allows users to select and copy text right from documents embedded to a web-page.

<strong>Convenient Document Browsing.</strong> GroupDocs.Viewer for Java also has a web UI which you can embed to a web-page to let users easily navigate multi-page documents on your website. The UI allows users to search for text within documents, fit width/height or zoom in/out of a document, scroll pages or turn them with a button, preview pages with thumbnails, print and download documents, etc.
